/**
 The benefit of putting loadAndDisplay(match:) in an extension, is that it allows us to open a match from a local notification received in any scene in the app
 The trade off is that we no longer can use dependency injection with savedGameModels when moving to and from scenes and the Online Game.
 
 + The first solution was to make a new global reference to savedGameModels, which is considered a use of a singleton. Normally, when returning from an Online match, the GameScene prepares the MenuScene by passing its ```savedGameModels```. At this point the singleton savedGameModels in this SKScene extension was retrieved and substituted.
 + Now the best practice is access the appDelegate directly since the dependency we were injecting is referencing the instance in the appDelegate, and we don't want to have more than one floating around.

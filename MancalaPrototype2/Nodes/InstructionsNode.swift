 Presents a translucent overlay on the SKScene that holds text. Owns a string array of ```instructions``` to be presented sequentially through an animation that simulates a slide show.
 
 - Important: the code to perform the slide show must be passed to this ```InstructionsNode``` through the ```actionBlock``` in init()

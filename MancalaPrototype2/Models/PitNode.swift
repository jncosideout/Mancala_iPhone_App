/**
 The base data structure model of the Mancala gameboard
 
 ### Primary attributes
 1. ```name```:  this pit's id
    - range: 1-6, "BASE"
 2. ```player```:  the id of the player controlling this pit
    - range: 1,2
 3. ```beads```:  number of beads in the pit at the current time
    - range: 0 -> *
 ### Secondary attributes
 1. ```previousBeads```:  a queue of the history of values of ```beads``` accumulated during a move
    - used only for animating the pit during a wrap-around move
    - cleared after every move
 2. ```mostRecentBeads```: used for storing the last value of ```beads```
    - specifically used for animating a capture
 3. ```coordP1```: the point on the gameboard for this pit, from **Player 1's** perspective
 4. ```coordP1```: the point on the gameboard for this pit, from **Player 2's** perspective

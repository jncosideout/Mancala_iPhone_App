     1. Find the pit on the ```gameboard``` belonging to the opponent and sitting across the board from the capturing pit (```fromPit```).
     2. Transfer the beads from the opponent's adjacent pit (and the single bead that would have landed in ```fromPit```) to this player's "BASE" pit
    - Parameters:
       - fromPit: the ```PitNode``` owned by this MancalaPlayer from which the capture is initiated. This should always be the pit that the last bead fell into, and must belong to the player who began this turn.
       - gameboard: the ```CircularLinkedList<PitNode>)``` that is the ```gameboard``` this MancalaPlayer is playing on
     - Throws: ```captureError``` usually result from not finding a pitNode

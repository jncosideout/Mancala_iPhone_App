 Supports saving to disk and loading the ```GameData``` for the "VS Human" and "VS Computer" local game modes
 
 The ```SavedGameStore``` and its ```allSavedGames``` are not injected into the GameViewController nor passed to the SKScenes. Instead, a [```GameModel```] array is passed which is initialized with the ```GameData``` in ```allSavedGames```. When the appDelegate calls applicationDidEnterBackground(_:) the ```SavedGameStore``` saves ```allSavedGames``` to disk. At this time, ```allSavedGames``` needs to be overwritten with the data from the injected [```GameModel```] array.
 
 The separation is partly for uncoupling reasons, but also because of the attributes of the containers [```GameModel```] and [```GameData```]. The [```GameModel```] array is useful for maintaining references to the data, but GameModels are not optimized for serializiation. ```GameData``` is a struct so it cannot be passed by reference, but it conforms to Codable so it can be serialized.
 + Important: The classes that interact with this one and which reference the injected [```GameModel```] which corresponds to it, all expect that ```allSavedGames``` contains exactly 2 elements, and that the first element is the ```GameData``` of "VS Computer" mode and the second element is the ```GameData``` of "VS Human" or "2 Player Mode." Changing this will break things.
